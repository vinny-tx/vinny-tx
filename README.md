# Hey, I’m Vincent 👋

I'm a software engineer and product builder focused on turning ideas into real tools using Go, AI, and modern web tech.

Right now I’m working on **Dotlight**, a lightweight AI-powered team alignment assistant that helps teams recall decisions, goals, and priorities using OpenAI + RAG.

Previously at **Atlassian**, where I learned a ton about scale, strategy, and the gaps that exist in how teams align around execution.

## 🛠️ Tech I Work With
- **Languages:** Go, TypeScript, Python, C#
- **AI/ML:** OpenAI APIs, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), vector search
- **Infra:** Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, Supabase
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind
- **Tools:** VS Code, GitHub, Stripe, Vercel
